  The Chromium depot_tools suite contains many tools to assist/augment the Chromium development environment. The tools may be downloaded from here.

  There are two primary categories of tools. Some of these tools are essential to the development flow, in the sense that you cannot successfully develop Chromium without them.

  Other tools are merely helper tools. Not required, but they can substantially ease the development workflow.

  A listing of both categories of tools follows.
