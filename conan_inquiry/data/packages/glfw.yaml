  GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.
  GLFW natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux and other Unix-like systems. Experimental implementations for the Wayland protocol and the Mir display server are available but not yet officially supported.
